## Who shot first?

I wanted to look at who thinks that Greedo shot first (because everyone knows Han shot first).

Major takeaway: Did not learn very much.

* People who say Greedo shot first and people who say Han shot first have very similar orderings for how much they liked each movie. 
* People who don't understand the question seem to rank episodes 1-3 higher. 

So, I thought it might be an age thing.

* People who didn't understand the question skewed older. 
* But, nothing obvious one way or the other.

Missing data accounted for a huge part of this dataset. Omitting NAs was probably not a methodologically sound thing to do here. 

### Conclusion
I got nothin'.
