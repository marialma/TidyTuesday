## 9/4/2018 - Fast Food Calories

I decided to look at which chain, on average, would have the lowest fat, and which chain would have the lowest sodium. 
It was pretty interesting to see that most chains average around the same levels of sodium though Chik-Fil-A seems to have the lowest fat, on average. 
McDonalds apparently has some truly unhealthy offerings, though.
